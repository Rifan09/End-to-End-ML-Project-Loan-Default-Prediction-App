# 💸 End-to-End ML Project: Loan Default Prediction App

Welcome to the Loan Default Prediction App — an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict the probability of loan default based on customer features. This application leverages supervised learning models and is deployed with a modern web interface.

🧠 ML-powered insights for smarter credit risk management.

## 🚀 Features

```
🔹 Automated pipeline from raw data to prediction
🔹 Interactive dashboard for visual risk analysis
🔹 Machine Learning models trained on real-world loan datasets
🔹 Deployable as a web app (Flask + React or Streamlit)
🔹 Scalable architecture with cloud/database integration
```

## 🧭 Project Workflow

1. 🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

   * Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding
   * Feature engineering from raw data (e.g., credit history, income)

2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Correlation analysis, visual exploration, risk segmentation

3. 🧠 Model Training & Evaluation

   * Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   * Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

4. 💾 Model Saving

   * Serialize model using Pickle or Joblib
   * Save preprocessing pipeline

5. 🌐 Deployment

   * Backend: Flask API serving model predictions
   * Frontend: React or Streamlit dashboard for visualization & input
   * Optional: Docker containerization & cloud hosting (Render/Heroku/GCP)
